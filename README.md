# techy_selenium

This is the raw code for our Automatic Stock Replenishment service, which we created as a part of the 2018 Accenture Bootcamp.

As we had a range of levels and experience in Git and Java, we only pushed/pulled the raw source files, in folder src. The dependencies such as 
geckodriver, selenium and firefox were downloaded on each individual computer.
